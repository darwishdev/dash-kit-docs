        <p>Dash-kit is built on two robust libraries that contribute to its powerful functionalities:</p>
        <ol class="p-pl-3">
            <li><strong>Formkit:</strong><br /> Dash-kit leverages the capabilities of Formkit, which enhances the
                form-building process by providing an intuitive and flexible form creation system. Formkit simplifies form
                management, validation, and interaction with backend APIs, making it a perfect complement to Dash-kit's form
                generation capabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>PrimeVue:</strong><br /> As a component library, PrimeVue brings a wealth of UI elements to the
                table. Dash-kit utilizes PrimeVue's extensive collection of components to create consistent and visually
                appealing admin panels. From forms and buttons to menus and cards, PrimeVue ensures a polished and modern
                interface for your application.</li>
        </ol>
